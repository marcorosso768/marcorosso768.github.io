Welcome to my personal website! I'm glad you're here on purpose!

I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D. student in Economics under the supervision of [Paolo Vanin](https://sites.google.com/site/paolovanin/) and a Research Fellow under the supervision of [Giovanni Prarolo](https://sites.google.com/site/giovanniprarolo/) at the University of Bologna.

My research interests include political, crime, experimental, and behavioral economics, both theoretically and empirically.

Currently, I am focusing on:
<ul>
  <li>Self-Selection and Corruption</li>
  <li>Local Crime News and Voting Behavior</li>
</ul>
