Welcome to my personal website, I am glad you are here on purpose!

I am a <b>4<sup>th</sup>-year Ph.D. Student in Economics</b> under the supervision of [Paolo Vanin](https://sites.google.com/site/paolovanin/) and a <b>Research Fellow</u></b>&mdash;working with [Giovanni Prarolo](https://sites.google.com/site/giovanniprarolo/)&mdash;at the University of Bologna.

My <b>Research Interests</u></b> include <b>Political</u></b>, <b>Crime</u></b>, <b>Experimental</u></b>, and <b>Behavioral Economics</u></b>, both theoretically and empirically.

Currently, I am focusing on:
 <ul>
  <li>Self-Selection and Corruption</li>
  <li>Local Crime News and Voting Behavior</li>
  <li>Effects of Erasmus Programs on Voting</li>
</ul>

In addition to my Research Activities, I am the <b>Teaching Assistant</u></b> for the following courses: <b>Introduction to Behavioral Economics</u></b>, <b>Game Theory</u></b>, <b>Political Economy</u></b>, and <b>Microeconomics</u></b>.

I am also proud to organize the <b>DSE Afterwork Drinks</u></b>, a monthly informal meeting where Faculty, Research Fellows, and Ph.D. Students can meet to discuss various topics while enjoying a beverage.
