Welcome to my personal website—glad you got here of your own free will (or maybe you clicked by mistake: happens to the best of us).

I’m a <b style="color: $white-color;">5<sup>th</sup>-year PhD candidate in Economics</b> and a <b style="color: $white-color;">Post-Doc</b> (yes, we still exist) at the University of Bologna.

My <b style="color: $white-color;">research interests</b> orbit around <b style="color: $white-color;">Political Economy</b>, <b style="color: $white-color;">Economics of Crime</b>, <b style="color: $white-color;">Experimental Economics</b>, and <b style="color: $white-color;">Behavioral Economics</b>—perfect for anyone who enjoys uncomfortable questions, ethical dilemmas, and datasets that are impossible to find.

Right now, I’m trying to make sense of things like:
<ul>
  <li>Who chooses to enter the public sector knowing they could steal… and why do we hire them?</li>
  <li>Do crime-related news stories actually influence how we vote?</li>
  <li>Does Erasmus really change us? (Or just our Spotify playlists?)</li>
</ul>

When I’m not trying to make sense of chaos (spoiler: chaos wins), I am the <b style="color: $white-color;">Teaching Assistant</b> for the following courses: <b style="color: $white-color;">Introduction to Behavioral Economics</b>, <b style="color: $white-color;">Game Theory</b>, <b style="color: $white-color;">Political Economy</b>, and <b style="color: $white-color;">Microeconomics</b>. Basically, I try to explain complex concepts using unlikely metaphors and fake confidence.

To top it off, I’m also the <b style="color: $white-color;">Representative for Research Fellows</b> both in the <b style="color: $white-color;">Department Council</b> and the <b style="color: $white-color;">Department Committee</b>. Translation: I sit through long meetings with too many slides and nod professionally.

And finally, to give meaning to this whole circus: I organize the <b style="color: $white-color;">DSE Afterwork Drinks</b>. A monthly event where we talk about academia, life, broken dreams, and calls for proposals about to expire—though with a drink in hand, which changes everything.

My favorite quote?<br>
<i>"No, I'm not obsessive-compulsive. I just like to wash my hands."</i><br>
If you laughed, we might actually become friends. If not… try reading it again.
