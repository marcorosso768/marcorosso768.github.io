<b>Introduction</b> <i>The ability to return to work after a cancer diagnosis is a key aspect of cancer survivorship and quality of life. Studies have reported a significant risk of income loss for cancer survivors; however, there is limited evidence of the Italian context.</i>
 <br>
<b>Methods</b> <i>The Work Histories Italian Panel (WHIP)-Salute database was used to select a cohort of incident cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) among workers in the private sector, based on hospital discharges. A propensity score matching was used to find a balanced control group for several confounders. Ordinary least square and logistic regressions were used to estimate the effect of a CRC diagnosis on annual income and the probability of switching from a full-time contract to a part-time one considering 3 years after the diagnosis.</i>
 <br>
<b>Results</b> <i>Overall, we identified 925 CRC incident cases from 2006 until 2012. Our results confirm a statistically significant reduction in survivors’ income compared with controls. This reduction was greater in the first year and then tend to decrease, with an average income loss over 3 years of about €12 000. Stratified analyses by sex and position confirmed the overall trend while indicating a strong effect modification. Regarding the switching from full-time to part-time employment, the results were never significant.</i>
 <br>
<b>Conclusion</b> <i>Income loss does not seem to be related to an increase in part-time contracts, but rather to survivors’ reduced work capacity following the invasive treatments. Further research is needed to investigate the complex dynamics behind this association.</i>

<i> This study investigates the influence of crime news on individual voting behavior, focusing on the city of Bologna (IT). By conducting a survey of 5000 geolocated individuals and analyzing newspaper articles from 2011 to 2021, the research examines the differential effects of crime news pertaining to Italians and immigrants. To achieve identification, we estimate a fixed effect model including district trends and exploiting the plausible random variation in the timing of crimes between zones within the same district. Preliminary findings suggest that crime articles related to immigrants significantly impact voting behavior, leading to shifts in party preferences during national and local elections. These insights shed light on the dynamics of populism and democratic processes. The research offers valuable implications for understanding media influence on political outcomes and highlights the significance of crime news in shaping electoral choices. </i> </p>

<p> - <i> Corruption, temptation, and self-selection in the public sector </i> </p>

<i> This paper presents a theoretical model that examines the impact of corruption opportunities on the self-selection process of individuals in the public sector. The study explores how the temptation of engaging in corruption influences individuals' career choices. The main finding of the research reveals a dual effect of corruption opportunities in the public sector. On one hand, such opportunities attract individuals with lower ambition and motivation, who are more likely to engage in unethical behavior. On the other hand, when the temptation to participate in corruption becomes significant, highly motivated individuals may be deterred from pursuing a career in the public sector due to self-control issues, leading them to opt for employment in the private sector instead. This finding highlights the importance of considering the impact of corruption and self-control problems on the quality and composition of the public sector workforce, which can have broader implications for economic outcomes. </i> </p>
