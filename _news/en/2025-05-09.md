Excited to present <i>“Crime Perceptions and Voting Behavior: Evidence from Individual Data”</i> (a joint work with <i>[Giovanni Prarolo](https://sites.google.com/site/giovanniprarolo/)</i>) at the <b>BoMoPaV Economics Meeting 2025</b>, on May 28 at the <i>[“Marco Biagi” Department of Economics](https://www.economia.unimore.it/en)</i> (<i>[UniMORE](https://www.unimore.it/en)</i). Many thanks to <i>[Orestis Troumpounis](https://www.unive.it/data/people/29055111)—I’m looking forward to his discussion and insights.
