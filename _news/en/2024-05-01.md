I am excited to begin a 15-month <b>Research Fellowship</b> in the [Deparment of Economics](https://dse.unibo.it/en) at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage) on <b>democratization, media, socio-economic factors, and voting behavior</b>, with a focus on local contexts and individual voting patterns.
